I am a Python programmer most of the time and was really pleased to see something akin to the "Black" package for web dev type languages (e.g., html, css, javascript, markdown, yaml). It's just a nice automatic formatter. I find javascript/typscript files tend to get messy really quickly. I don't know why, maybe it's because they have lots of nested things? In any case, this tool is like magic. There are plugins for most IDEs, including VS Code, and you can set it up to run on save or you can make git commit hooks. It is pretty fantastic. 100% recommend.
